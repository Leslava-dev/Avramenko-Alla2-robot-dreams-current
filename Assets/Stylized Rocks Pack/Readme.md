THANK YOU FOR PURCHASING THIS STYLIZED PACK!

Getting Started:

- Go to either the URP or Built-in folder, depending on which pipeline you're using.
- Inside the folder you'll find all the rock types.
- Choose any rock type, and there's a Prefabs folder with game-ready prefabs of all the colors of the chosen rock type.
- Drag and drop the rock of your choice into your scene and that's it!
